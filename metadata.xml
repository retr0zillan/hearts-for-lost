    <description>Ayo! This is my first mod ever for The Binding of Isaac, and it came from pure frustration playing as Tainted Lost. This little guy is hardcore punished just for existing—one hit and it’s game over. Sure, holy cards are supposed to give you a free hit, but after the first one, it feels like they never spawn again. So I thought: why not give Lost characters a real use for hearts? 

And shops? Don’t worry, hearts won’t clog your store anymore. While playing as Lost or Tainted Lost, hearts are replaced with other items, keeping the shop actually useful.</description>
